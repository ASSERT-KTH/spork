/**
 * Create the class representatives mapping. The class representatives for the different revisions are defined as:
 *
 * 1. A node NB in base is its own class representative.
 * 2. The class representative of a node NL in left is NB if there exists a tree matching NL -> NB in the baseLeft
 * matching. Otherwise it is NL.
 * 3. The class representative of a node NR in right is NB if there exists a tree matching NR -> NB in the baseRight
 * matching. If that is not the case, the class representative may be NL if there exists a tree matching
 * NL -> NR. The latter is referred to as an augmentation, and is done conservatively to avoid spurious
 * mappings between left and right revisions. See [ClassRepresentativeAugmenter] for more info.
 *
 * Put briefly, base nodes are always mapped to themselves, nodes in left are mapped to base nodes if they are
 * matched, and nodes in right are mapped to base nodes or left nodes if they are matched, with base matchings
 * having priority.
 *
 * @param base      The base revision.
 * @param left      The left revision.
 * @param right     The right revision.
 * @param baseLeft  A matching from base to left.
 * @param baseRight A matching from base to right.
 * @param leftRight A matching from left to right.
 * @return The class representatives map.

/**
 * A scanner that conservatively expands the class representatives mapping with matches from a left-to-right
 * tree matching. If a node in the left tree is not mapped to base (i.e. self-mapped in the class
 * representatives map), but it is matched with some node in right, then the node in right is mapped
 * to the node in left iff their parents are already mapped, and the node in right is also self-mapped.
 * The node in left remains self-mapped.
 *
 * This must be done by traversing the left tree top-down to allow augmenting mappings to propagate. For
 * example, if both the left and the right revision have added identical methods, then their declarations
 * will be mapped first, and then their contents will be mapped recursively (which is OK as the
 * declarations are now mapped). If one would have started with matches in the bodies of the methods,
 * then these would not be added to the class representatives map as the declarations (i.e. parents)
 * would not yet be mapped.
 *
 * The reason for this conservative use of the left-to-right matchings is that there is otherwise a high
 * probability of unwanted matches. For example, if the left revision adds a parameter to some method,
 * and the right revision adds an identical parameter to another method, then these may be matched,
 * even though they are not related. If that match is put into the class representatives map, there
 * may be some really strange effects on the merge process.
